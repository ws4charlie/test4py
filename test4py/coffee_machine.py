#o  Coffee machine location

#ยง  There is an office with developers; we want to install a new coffee machine.
#   Please, find an optimal location for the new coffee machine.

#ยง  This office is represented by a bidimensional array of Booleans. (bool[][] office)

#ยง  optimal = min(sum(distance to each developer))

# coffee machine should be in one of these cubicals
